8 Act II. Scene I. Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius
9 Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
10 Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me. Exit.
11 A double blessing is a double grace;
12 A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
13 A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
14 Against the which a moiety competent
15 Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
16 Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
17 A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
18 A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
19 A little month, or ere those shoes were old
20 All. Our duty to your honour.
21 All my smooth body.
22 All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
23 Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
24 And I am sick at heart.
25 And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
26 And I with them the third night kept the watch;
27 And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
28 And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
29 And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
30 And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
31 And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
32 And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
33 And carriage of the article design'd,
34 And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
35 And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
36 And draw you into madness? Think of it.
37 And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
38 And each particular hair to stand an end
39 And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
40 And even the like precurse of fierce events,
41 And foreign mart for implements of war;
42 And for my soul, what can it do to that,
43 And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
44 And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
45 And hears it roar beneath.
46 And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
47 And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
48 And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
49 And in the porches of my ears did pour
50 And it must follow, as the night the day,
51 And keep you in the rear of your affection,
52 And lay your hands again upon my sword.
53 And leads the will to desperate undertakings
54 And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
55 And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
56 And let us once again assail your ears,
57 And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
58 And makes each petty artire in this body
59 And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
60 And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
61 And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
62 And our vain blows malicious mockery.
63 And prey on garbage.
64 And prologue to the omen coming on,
65 And recks not his own rede.
66 And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
67 And, sister, as the winds give benefit
68 And so, without more circumstance at all,
69 And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
70 And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
71 And that in way of caution- I must tell you
72 And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
73 And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
74 And there assume some other, horrible form
75 And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
76 And these few precepts in thy memory
77 And they in France of the best rank and station
78 And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
79 And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
80 And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
81 And thy commandment all alone shall live
82 And to the last bended their light on me.
83 And to the manner born, it is a custom
84 And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
85 And vanish'd from our sight.
86 And we beseech you, bend you to remain
87 And we did think it writ down in our duty
88 And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
89 And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
90 And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
91 And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
92 And will not let belief take hold of him
93 And with a larger tether may he walk
94 And with a look so piteous in purport
95 And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
96 And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
97 And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
98 And with no less nobility of love
99 And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
100 And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
101 And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
102 An understanding simple and unschool'd;
103 Appears before them and with solemn march
104 Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
105 Are most select and generous, chief in that.
106 Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
107 (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
108 As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
109 A sable silver'd.
110 As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
111 As are companions noted and most known
112 A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
113 A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
114 As harbingers preceding still the fates
115 As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
116 As he in his particular act and place
117 As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
118 As if he had been loosed out of hell
119 As if increase of appetite had grown
120 As if it some impartment did desire
121 As infinite as man may undergo-
122 As in their birth, â€“ wherein they are not guilty,
123 As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
124 As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
125 As it doth well appear unto our state,
126 As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
127 As meditation or the thoughts of love,
128 As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
129 As of a father; for let the world take note
130 As oft as any passion under heaven
131 As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
132 As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
133 As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
134 As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
135 As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
136 As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
137 At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
138 At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark. [Writes.]
139 At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
140 A violet in the youth of primy nature,
141 Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
142 A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
143 Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
144 Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
145 Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
146 Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
147 Before You visit him, to make inquire
148 Being a thing immortal as itself?
149 Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
150 Believe so much in him, that he is young,
151 Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
152 Ber. He.
153 Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
154 Ber. I have seen nothing.
155 Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
156 Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
157 Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
158 Ber. It would be spoke to.
159 Ber. Last night of all,
160 Ber. Long live the King!
161 Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
162 Ber. Say-
163 Ber. See, it stalks away!
164 Ber. Sit down awhile,
165 Ber. 'Tis here!
166 Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
167 Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
168 Ber. Well, good night.
169 Ber. Who's there.?
170 Bernardo, officer.
171 Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
172 Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
173 Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
174 Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
175 Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
176 Both. Arm'd, my lord.
177 Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.
178 Both. Longer, longer.
179 Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
180 Both. My lord, from head to foot.
181 Both. My lord, we will not.
182 Break we our watch up; and by my advice
183 Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
184 Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
185 Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
186 But I have that within which passeth show-
187 But answer made it none. Yet once methought
188 But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
189 But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!
190 But come!
191 But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
192 But do not go with it!
193 But even then the morning cock crew loud,
194 But he's an arrant knave.
195 But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
196 But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
197 But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
198 But let me hear from you.
199 But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
200 But mere implorators of unholy suits,
201 But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
202 But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
203 But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
204 But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
205 But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
206 But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
207 But this eternal blazon must not be
208 But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
209 But to my mind, though I am native here
210 But to recover of us, by strong hand
211 But truly I do fear it.
212 But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
213 But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
214 But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
215 But what is your affair in Elsinore?
216 But you'll be secret?
217 But you must know, your father lost a father;
218 By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me! -
219 By indirections find directions out.
220 By laboursome petition, and at last
221 By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
222 By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
223 By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
224 By this encompassment and drift of question
225 By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
226 Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
227 Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
228 Claudius, King of Denmark.
229 Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
230 Come hither, gentlemen,
231 Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
232 Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
233 Consent to swear.
234 Contagious blastments are most imminent.
235 Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
236 Cornelius, courtier.
237 Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
238 Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
239 Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
240 Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
241 Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
242 Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
243 Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
244 Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
245 Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
246 Do I impart toward you. For your intent
247 Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
248 Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
249 Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
250 Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
251 Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
252 Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.
253 Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
254 Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
255 Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
256 Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
257 Drabbing. You may go so far.

292 Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet
293 For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,
294 For every man hath business and desire,
295 For food and diet, to some enterprise
296 For he himself is subject to his birth.
297 For it is as the air, invulnerable,
298 For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
299 Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
300 For nature crescent does not grow alone
301 For out o' doors he went without their help
302 (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
303 For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
304 For they are actions that a man might play;
305 Fortinbras, Prince of Norway.
306 Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
307 For what we know must be, and is as common
308 (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
309 For your desire to know what is between us,
310 Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
311 Fran. Bernardo?
312 Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
313 Fran. Give you good night.
314 Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
315 Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
316 Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
317 Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
318 Francisco, a soldier
319 From me, whose love was of that dignity
320 From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
321 From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
322 From the first corse till he that died to-day,
323 From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
324 Getrude, Queen of Denmark, mother to Hamlet.
325 Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
326 Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
327 Ghost. I find thee apt;
328 Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
329 Ghost. Mark me.
330 Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
331 Ghost. My hour is almost come,
332 Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
333 Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
334 Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
335 Ghost. Swear.
336 Ghost beckons Hamlet.
337 [Ghost beckons.]
338 Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
339 Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
340 Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
341 Ghost cries under the stage.
342 Ghost of Hamlet's Father.
343 Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
344 Give it an understanding but no tongue.
345 Give me one poor request.
346 Given private time to you, and you yourself
347 Give you good night. Exit.
348 Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
349 Giving to you no further personal power
350 God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
351 Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
352 'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
353 Go on. I'll follow thee.
354 Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
355 Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
356 Guildenstern, courtier.
357 Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart
358 Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
359 Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
360 Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
361 Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
362 Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
363 Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
364 Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
365 Ham. Arm'd, say you?
366 Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
367 Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
368 Ham. But where was this?
369 Ham. Did you not speak to it?
370 Ham. For God's love let me hear!
371 Ham. From top to toe?
372 Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
373 Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
374 Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
375 Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
376 Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
377 Ham. Hold off your hands!
378 Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
379 Ham. I am glad to see you well.
380 Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
381 Ham. I am very glad to see you. â€“ [To Bernardo] Good even, sir. -
382 Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
383 Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
384 Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
385 Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
386 Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
387 Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
388 Ham. It waves me still.
389 Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
390 Ham. I will watch to-night.
391 Ham. I will.
392 Ham. I would I had been there.
393 Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
394 Ham. Murther?
395 Ham. My fate cries out
396 Ham. Nay, but swear't.
397 Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
398 Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
399 Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
400 Ham. No, you will reveal it.
401 Ham. O God!
402 Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
403 Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
404 Ham. O my prophetic soul!
405 Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
406 Ham. Pale or red?
407 Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
408 Ham. Saw? who?
409 Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
410 Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
411 Ham. So be it!
412 Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
413 Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
414 Ham. The King my father?
415 Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
416 Ham. Then saw you not his face?
417 Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
418 Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
419 Ham. 'Tis very strange.
420 Ham. Upon my sword.
421 Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
422 Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
423 Ham. What hour now?
424 Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
425 Ham. What?
426 Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
427 Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
428 Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
429 Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
430 Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
431 Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
432 Hamlet, son to the former, and nephew to the present king.
433 Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
434 Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
435 Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
436 Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
437 Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
438 Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
439 Have you so slander any moment leisure
440 Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
441 He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
442 He closes with you in this consequence:
443 He falls to such perusal of my face
444 He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
445 He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
446 He may not, as unvalued persons do,
447 He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
448 Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
449 Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
450 He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
451 He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
452 Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
453 His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
454 His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
455 His further gait herein, in that the levies,
456 His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
457 Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
458 Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
459 Holds such an enmity with blood of man
460 Hold you the watch to-night?
461 Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
462 Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
463 Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing
464 Hor. A piece of him.
465 Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
466 Hor. As thou art to thyself.
467 Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
468 Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
469 Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
470 Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
471 Hor. Do not, my lord!
472 Hor. Friends to this ground.
473 Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
474 Hor. Hail to your lordship!
475 Hor. Have after. To what issue wail this come?
476 Hor. Heaven secure him!
477 Hor. Heaven will direct it.
478 Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
479 Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
480 Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
481 Hor. In faith,
482 Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
483 Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
484 Hor. Is it a custom?
485 Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
486 Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
487 Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
488 Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
489 Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
490 Hor. I warr'nt it will.
491 Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
492 Hor. Most constantly.
493 Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
494 Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
495 Hor. My lord, I did;
496 Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
497 Hor. My lord, the King your father.
498 Hor. Nay, very pale.
499 Hor. No, by no means!
500 Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
501 Hor. Not when I saw't.
502 Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
503 Hor. O, where, my lord?
504 Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
505 Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.
506 Hor. Season your admiration for a while
507 Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
508 Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
509 Hor. That can I.
510 Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
511 Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
512 Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
513 Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
514 Hor. 'Tis here!
515 Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
516 Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
517 Hor. Well, sit we down,
518 Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
519 Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
520 Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
521 Hor. What news, my lord?
522 Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
523 Horatio, friend to Hamlet.
524 Horatio! â€“ or I do forget myself.
525 Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!
526 How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
527 How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
528 How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
529 Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
530 I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
531 I do beseech you give him leave to go.
532 I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
533 I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
534 If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
535 If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
536 If there be any good thing to be done,
537 If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
538 If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
539 If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
540 If with too credent ear you list his songs,
541 If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
542 If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
543 I have sworn't.
544 I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
545 I'll cross it, though it blast me. â€“ Stay illusion!
546 I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
547 I'll visit you.
548 I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
549 I made to her in marriage, and to decline
550 Importing the surrender of those lands
551 In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
552 In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
553 In filial obligation for some term
554 In going back to school in Wittenberg,
555 In honourable fashion.
556 In obstinate condolement is a course
557 In the dead vast and middle of the night
558 In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
559 In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
560 In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
561 In which the majesty of buried Denmark
562 I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
563 'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
564 I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
565 I say, away! â€“ Go on. I'll follow thee.
566 Is by a forged process of my death
567 Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
568 I shall not look upon his like again.
569 Is not this something more than fantasy?
570 I stay too long. But here my father comes.
571 Is the main motive of our preparations,
572 It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
573 I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
574 It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'
575 It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
576 It is most retrograde to our desire;
577 It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
578 It lifted up it head and did address
579 Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
580 It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
581 It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
582 It waves you to a more removed ground.
583 I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
584 I would know that.
585 I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
586 Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
587 King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
588 King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
589 King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
590 King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
591 King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
592 King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
593 King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
594 King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
595 Laer. Farewell. Exit.
596 Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
597 Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
598 Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
599 Laer. My dread lord,
600 Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
601 Laer. O, fear me not!
602 Laer. Think it no more.
603 Laertes, son to Polonius.
604 Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
605 Let it be tenable in your silence still;
606 Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
607 Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman! -
608 Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
609 Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
610 Let us impart what we have seen to-night
611 Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
612 Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.
613 Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
614 Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
615 Look you, I'll go pray.
616 Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
617 Lords, ladies, Officers, Soldiers, Sailors, Messengers, Attendants.
618 Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
619 Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
620 Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
621 Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
622 Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
623 Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
624 Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
625 Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
626 Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
627 Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
628 Mar. Is it not like the King?
629 Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
630 Mar. It is offended.
631 Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
632 Mar. Look with what courteous action
633 Mar. Lord Hamlet!
634 Mar. My good lord!
635 Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
636 Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
637 Mar. No, it is struck.
638 Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
639 Mar. Nor I, my lord.
640 Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
641 Mar. O, wonderful!
642 Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
643 Mar. Question it, Horatio.
644 Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
645 Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
646 Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
647 Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
648 Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
649 Mar. 'Tis gone!
650 Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
651 Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
652 Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
653 Marcellus, Officer.
654 (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
655 Marcellus, officer.
656 Marcellus?
657 Mark you,
658 May do t' express his love and friending to you,
659 May give his saying deed; which is no further
660 May sweep to my revenge.
661 More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
662 Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
663 Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
664 Must render up myself.
665 My custom always of the afternoon,
666 My father- methinks I see my father.
667 My father's brother, but no more like my father
668 My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
669 My lord, not I.
670 My tables! Meet it is I set it down
671 My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
672 My uncle?
673 Nay, come, let's go together.
674 Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
675 Never to speak of this that you have heard:
676 No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
677 No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
678 No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
679 No more.
680 No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
681 Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
682 Nor customary suits of solemn black,
683 No reckoning made, but sent to my account
684 Nor shall you do my ear that violence
685 Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
686 Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
687 Not of that dye which their investments show,
688 Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
689 Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
690 Now wears his crown.
691 (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
692 O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
693 Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
694 O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,
695 Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
696 Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
697 Of general assault.
698 Of his affection to me.
699 Of his behaviour.
700 Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
701 Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
702 Of man and country-
703 Of mine own eyes.
704 Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
705 Of these dilated articles allow. [Gives a paper.]
706 Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
707 Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
708 Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
709 O most pernicious woman!
710 Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
711 Oph. Do you doubt that?
712 Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
713 Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
714 Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
715 Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
716 Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
717 Oph. My lord, I do not know,
718 Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
719 Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
720 Oph. No more but so?
721 Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
722 Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
723 Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
724 Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
725 Ophelia, daughter to Polonius.

727 Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
728 Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens

730 Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
731 Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open

746 Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
747 Passing through nature to eternity.
748 Perchance 'twill walk again.
749 Players.
750 Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
751 Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
752 Pol. And let him ply his music.
753 Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to

761 Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
762 Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
763 Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave

765 Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
766 Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
767 Pol. Marry, well bethought!
768 Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
769 Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.
770 Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
771 Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
772 Pol. What said he?
773 Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
774 Pol. With what, i' th' name of God I

825 So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
826 So, by my former lecture and advice,
827 So excellent a king, that was to this
828 So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
829 So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
830 So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
831 So horridly to shake our disposition
832 Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
833 So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,

835 So nightly toils the subject of the land,
836 So oft it chances in particular men
837 So to seduce! â€“ won to his shameful lust

843 Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me

845 Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
846 Such was the very armour he had on
847 Swear by my sword.
848 Swear by my sword.
849 Swear.
850 Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
851 Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
852 Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
853 Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
854 Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
855 Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
856 Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
857 Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
858 Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
859 Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
860 Than that which dearest father bears his son
861 Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
862 Than your particular demands will touch it.
863 That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
864 That are so fortified against our story,
865 That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
866 'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
867 That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
868 That ever I was born to set it right!
869 That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
870 That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
871 That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
872 That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
873 That he is open to incontinency.
874 That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
875 That, if again this apparition come,
876 That it went hand in hand even with the vow
877 That looks so many fadoms to the sea
878 That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
879 That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
880 That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
881 That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
882 That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
883 That swift as quicksilverr it courses through
884 That they do know my son, come you more nearer
885 That they may seem the taints of liberty,
886 That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
887 That was and is the question of these wars.
888 That we with wisest sorrow think on him
889 That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
890 That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
891 That you know aught of me- this is not to do,

920 The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark
921 The Tragedy of Hamlet,
922 The apparition comes. I knew your father.
923 The bell then beating one-
924 The better to beguile. This is for all:
925 The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
926 The canker galls the infants of the spring
927 The chariest maid is prodigal enough
928 The cock crows.
929 The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
930 The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
931 The form of plausive manners, that these men
932 The glowworm shows the matin to be near
933 The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
934 The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
935 The head is not more native to the heart,
936 The inward service of the mind and soul
937 Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
938 The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
939 The leperous distilment; whose effect
940 The lists, and full proportions are all made
941 The memory be green, and that it us befitted
942 The natural gates and alleys of the body,
943 Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
944 The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
945 Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
946 The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
947 The pith and marrow of our attribute.
948 There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
949 There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
950 Therefore I have entreated him along,
951 Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
952 Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
953 There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
954 The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
955 The safety and health of this whole state,
956 These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
957 These hands are not more like.
958 The serpent that did sting thy father's life
959 The source of this our watch, and the chief head
960 The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
961 The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
962 The triumph of his pledge.
963 The very place puts toys of desperation,
964 The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
965 The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
966 The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
967 Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
968 They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
969 The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
970 [They swear.]
971 Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
972 This above all- to thine own self be true,
973 This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
974 This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
975 This heavy-headed revel east and west
976 This is the very ecstasy of love,
977 This marvel to you.
978 'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
979 This present object made probation.
980 This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
981 This unprevailing woe, and think of us
982 Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
983 Thou canst not then be false to any man.
984 Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
985 Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
986 Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
987 Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
988 Thus much the business is: we have here writ
989 Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
990 Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
991 Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
992 Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
993 'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
994 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
995 'Tis strange.
996 'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
997 To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
998 To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
999 To be contracted in one brow of woe,
1000 To business with the King, more than the scope
1001 To cast thee up again. What may this mean
1002 To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever
1003 To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
1004 Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
1005 Together with remembrance of ourselves.
1006 Together with that fair and warlike form
1007 To give these mourning duties to your father;
1008 To his confine; and of the truth herein
1009 To his unmast'red importunity.
1010 To let you know of it.
1011 To make it truster of your own report
1012 To offer it the show of violence;
1013 Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
1014 To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
1015 To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
1016 To put an antic disposition on),
1017 To reason most absurd, whose common theme
1018 To show my duty in your coronation,
1019 To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
1020 To tell the secrets of my prison house,
1021 To tell us this.
1022 To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
1023 To those of mine!
1024 Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
1025 To what I shall unfold.
1026 To you alone.
1027 To youth and liberty.
1028 Two Clowns, gravediggers.
1029 Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
1030 Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
1031 Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
1032 Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
1033 Unto our climature and countrymen.
1034 Unto the voice and yielding of that body
1035 Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
1036 Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
1037 Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
1038 Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
1039 Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
1040 Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
1041 Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
1042 Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
1043 Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
1044 Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
1045 Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
1046 Voltemand, courtier.
1047 Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
1048 Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
1049 Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
1050 Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
1051 We do it wrong, being so majestical,
1052 Well may it sort that this portentous figure
1053 Well ratified by law and heraldry,
1054 We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
1055 What I have said to you.
1056 What company, at what expense; and finding
1057 What does this mean, my lord?
1058 What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
1059 What, have you given him any hard words of late?
1060 What, is Horatio there ?
1061 What is between you? Give me up the truth.
1062 What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
1063 What think you on't?
1064 What we two nights have seen.
1065 What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
1066 When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
1067 When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
1068 When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
1069 When yond same star that's westward from the pole
1070 Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
1071 Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
1072 Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
1073 Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
1074 Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
1075 Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
1076 Where we shall find him most conveniently. Exeunt.
1077 Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
1078 Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
1079 Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
1080 Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
1081 Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
1082 Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
1083 Who hath reliev'd you?
1084 Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
1085 Who is't that can inform me?
1086 Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
1087 Whose violent property fordoes itself
1088 Why seems it so particular with thee?
1089 Why should we in our peevish opposition
1090 Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
1091 Why this same strict and most observant watch
1092 Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
1093 William Shakespeare
1094 Will sate itself in a celestial bed
1095 With all my imperfections on my head.
1096 With all my love I do commend me to you;
1097 With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
1098 With an attent ear, till I may deliver
1099 With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
1100 With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
1101 Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd
1102 Within the book and volume of my brain,
1103 With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
1104 With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
1105 With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
1106 Without more motive, into every brain
1107 Without the sensible and true avouch
1108 With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
1109 With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
1110 With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
1111 With us to watch the minutes of this night,
1112 With which she followed my poor father's body
1113 With windlasses and with assays of bias,
1114 With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
1115 Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
1116 Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
1117 Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;
1118 Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
1119 Yea, from the table of my memory
1120 Yes, faith, heartily.
1121 Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
1122 Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
1123 You are the most immediate to our throne,
1124 You, as your business and desires shall point you,
1125 You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
1126 You do not understand yourself so clearly
1127 You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
1128 You laying these slight sullies on my son
1129 You must not put another scandal on him,
1130 You must not take for fire. From this time
1131 Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
1132 Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
1133 Your leave and favour to return to France;
1134 Your party in converse, him you would sound,
1135 Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
1136 You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?

3 That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
4 That looks so many fadoms to the sea
5 Enter Laertes and Ophelia.
6 Enter Ophelia.
7 Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
8 Pol. And let him ply his music.
9 The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
10 Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
11 The source of this our watch, and the chief head
12 With all my imperfections on my head.
13 But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
14 And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
15 And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
16 Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
17 Will sate itself in a celestial bed
18 Mar. It is offended.
19 Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
20 And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
21 Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
22 Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
23 Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
24 Ham. Pale or red?
25 When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
26 Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
27 Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
28 Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
29 The memory be green, and that it us befitted
30 Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
31 Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
32 Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
33 Hor. My lord, I did;
34 In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
35 Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
36 Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
37 Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
38 So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
39 Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
40 But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
41 Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd
42 Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
43 Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
44 A little month, or ere those shoes were old
45 To what I shall unfold.
46 An understanding simple and unschool'd;
47 And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
48 Seem to me all the uses of this world!
49 No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
50 As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
51 But to recover of us, by strong hand
52 Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
53 So nightly toils the subject of the land,
54 Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
55 You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
56 Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
57 Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
58 Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
59 For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
60 And each particular hair to stand an end
61 Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
62 And carriage of the article design'd,
63 Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
64 The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
65 Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
66 Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
67 Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
68 And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
69 That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
70 He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
71 It waves you to a more removed ground.
72 Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
73 Hor. Friends to this ground.
74 Your party in converse, him you would sound,
75 Ham. O God!
76 His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
77 Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
78 It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
79 A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
80 As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
81 Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
82 Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
83 Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
84 Never to speak of this that you have heard:
85 'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
86 Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
87 Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
88 Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
89 A sable silver'd.
90 Laer. My dread lord,
91 Mar. My good lord!
92 Rey. But, my good lord-
93 Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
94 Mar. Nor I, my lord.
95 Both. Arm'd, my lord.
96 Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
97 Rey. Very good, my lord.
98 Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
99 Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!
100 Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
101 Hor. O, where, my lord?
102 Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
103 Rey. As gaming, my lord.
104 Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
105 Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.
106 Rey. I shall, my lord.
107 Rey. Well, my lord.
108 Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.
109 Rey. I will, my lord.
110 What does this mean, my lord?
111 Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.
112 Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
113 Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
114 Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
115 Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
116 Hor. What news, my lord?
117 Hor. Do not, my lord!
118 Rey. Ay, my lord,
119 Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
120 Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
121 Ham. Upon my sword.
122 And lay your hands again upon my sword.
123 Swear by my sword.
124 Swear by my sword.
125 I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
126 So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
127 Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
128 The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
129 Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
130 But even then the morning cock crew loud,

136 Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
137 Queen. If it be,

139 Ham. Then saw you not his face?
140 He falls to such perusal of my face
141 As he in his particular act and place
142 Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
143 A double blessing is a double grace;
144 Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
145 He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
146 If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
147 Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
148 So, by my former lecture and advice,
149 Break we our watch up; and by my advice
150 There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
151 My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
152 Your leave and favour to return to France;
153 Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
154 More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
155 To offer it the show of violence;
156 Nor shall you do my ear that violence
157 Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
158 He closes with you in this consequence:
159 To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
160 The lists, and full proportions are all made
161 And recks not his own rede.
162 Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
163 I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
164 Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
165 And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
166 Why seems it so particular with thee?
167 Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
168 In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
169 But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
170 I say, away! â€“ Go on. I'll follow thee.
171 Go on. I'll follow thee.
172 Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
173 The serpent that did sting thy father's life
174 Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
175 Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
176 And prey on garbage.
177 With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
178 Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
179 Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
180 He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
181 Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
182 Ghost cries under the stage.
183 The triumph of his pledge.
184 And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
185 'Tis strange.
186 Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
187 Ham. 'Tis very strange.
188 May sweep to my revenge.
189 Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
190 Pol. What said he?
191 Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she

197 Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
198 Hor. Nay, very pale.
199 'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
200 For it is as the air, invulnerable,
201 How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
202 Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
203 Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!

205 Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;
206 Ber. Sit down awhile,
207 Hor. Season your admiration for a while
208 Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
209 In equal scale weighing delight and dole,

219 Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
220 Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
221 To reason most absurd, whose common theme
222 To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
223 So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
224 Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
225 You must not take for fire. From this time
226 Ghost. Mark me.
227 Who is't that can inform me?
228 And to the last bended their light on me.
229 If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
230 In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
231 Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
232 I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
233 Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
234 Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
235 That, if again this apparition come,
236 Hor. Have after. To what issue wail this come?
237 Ghost. My hour is almost come,
238 But come!
239 That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
240 Speak to me.
241 Speak to me.
242 Of his affection to me.
243 Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
244 It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'
245 King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
246 Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
247 By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me! -
248 Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
249 You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
250 King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
251 I made to her in marriage, and to decline
252 To those of mine!
253 The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
254 Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.
255 Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
256 If there be any good thing to be done,
257 Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
258 The bell then beating one-
259 Mar. 'Tis gone!
260 Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
261 To you alone.
262 For nature crescent does not grow alone
263 You are the most immediate to our throne,
264 Ham. From top to toe?
265 These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
266 To be contracted in one brow of woe,
267 I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
268 Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
269 Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
270 To business with the King, more than the scope
271 William Shakespeare
272 Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
273 But to my mind, though I am native here
274 And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
275 Ber. 'Tis here!
276 Hor. 'Tis here!
277 That youth and observation copied there,
278 Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
279 Ham. I would I had been there.
280 What, is Horatio there ?
281 O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
282 Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
283 Ber. Who's there.?
284 Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
285 And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
286 As if it some impartment did desire
287 For every man hath business and desire,
288 Out of the shot and danger of desire.
289 It is most retrograde to our desire;
290 Before You visit him, to make inquire
291 No more.
292 Laer. Think it no more.
293 SCENE. â€“ Elsinore
294 SCENE. â€“ Elsinore
295 But what is your affair in Elsinore?
296 Well may it sort that this portentous figure
297 Have you so slander any moment leisure
298 Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
299 Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
300 Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
301 That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
302 A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
303 A violet in the youth of primy nature,
304 They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
305 Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
306 Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
307 Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
308 For food and diet, to some enterprise
309 Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
310 As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
311 Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
312 In obstinate condolement is a course
313 To tell the secrets of my prison house,
314 Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
315 There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
316 If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
317 What, have you given him any hard words of late?
318 'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
319 Set your entreatments at a higher rate
320 Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
321 The safety and health of this whole state,
322 This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
323 As it doth well appear unto our state,
324 The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
325 As of a father; for let the world take note
326 Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
327 The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
328 What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
329 The pith and marrow of our attribute.
330 The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
331 Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
332 Give it an understanding but no tongue.
333 But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!
334 This above all- to thine own self be true,
335 Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
336 By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
337 Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
338 Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
339 Rey. My lord, I have.
340 But he's an arrant knave.
341 Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
342 Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
343 And thy commandment all alone shall live
344 Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
345 Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
346 Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
347 As meditation or the thoughts of love,
348 This is the very ecstasy of love,
349 And with no less nobility of love
350 Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
351 If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
352 Pol. Mad for thy love?
353 As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
354 No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
355 With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
356 Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
357 Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
358 Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
359 Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
360 Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
361 A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
362 Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
363 Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
364 Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.
365 Given private time to you, and you yourself
366 Being a thing immortal as itself?
367 Whose violent property fordoes itself
368 Hor. As thou art to thyself.
369 Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
370 Must render up myself.
371 How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
372 Horatio! â€“ or I do forget myself.
373 Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
374 That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
375 Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
376 Mar. Is it not like the King?
377 Ber. Long live the King!
378 Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
379 I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
380 What company, at what expense; and finding
381 Ber. I have seen nothing.
382 Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing
383 Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
384 As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
385 That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
386 Hamlet, son to the former, and nephew to the present king.
387 At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
388 Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
389 Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,

391 Rey. Good my lord! [Going.]
392 Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
393 The canker galls the infants of the spring
394 Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
395 Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
396 Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
397 Therefore I have entreated him along,
398 The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
399 Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
400 Believe so much in him, that he is young,
401 But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
402 In going back to school in Wittenberg,
403 I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
404 And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
405 Appears before them and with solemn march
406 And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
407 Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
408 And I with them the third night kept the watch;
409 (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
410 With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
411 Why this same strict and most observant watch
412 Without the sensible and true avouch
413 The chariest maid is prodigal enough
414 That swift as quicksilverr it courses through
415 Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
416 (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
417 Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
418 King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
419 Is by a forged process of my death
420 And hears it roar beneath.
421 Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
422 Hor. In faith,
423 Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
424 Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
425 By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
426 Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
427 Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
428 Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
429 'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
430 For he himself is subject to his birth.
431 I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
432 Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
433 Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
434 The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
435 Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
436 And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
437 What is between you? Give me up the truth.
438 Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
439 O, speak!
440 Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
441 Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
442 Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!

445 Mar. No, it is struck.

447 And with a larger tether may he walk
448 Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
449 And curd, like eager droppings into milk,

481 Prince of Denmark
482 Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
483 Claudius, King of Denmark.
484 A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
485 Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
486 And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
487 From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
488 Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
489 We do it wrong, being so majestical,
490 Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.
491 Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
492 With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
493 Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
494 But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
495 That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
496 Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
497 The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
498 From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
499 Ber. Last night of all,
500 That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
501 Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
502 The better to beguile. This is for all:
503 And so, without more circumstance at all,
504 And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
505 A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
506 As if he had been loosed out of hell
507 Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
508 But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
509 Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
510 Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
511 Pol. Farewell!
512 Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
513 King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
514 Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
515 Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
516 My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
517 Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
518 Ham. I am glad to see you well.
519 I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
520 Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
521 Let it be tenable in your silence still;
522 Ham. It waves me still.
523 Ham. I will.
524 Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
525 Hor. I warr'nt it will.
526 And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
527 Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
528 Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
529 Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
530 Mar. O, wonderful!
531 Ham. O my prophetic soul!
532 The inward service of the mind and soul
533 When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
534 Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
535 'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
536 Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
537 That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
538 (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
539 Hor. Heaven secure him!
540 And will not let belief take hold of him
541 Hor. A piece of him.
542 Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
543 Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
544 That we with wisest sorrow think on him
545 You must not put another scandal on him,
546 Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
547 This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
548 To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
549 Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
550 [who approaches him].
551 Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
552 Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
553 To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
554 And to the manner born, it is a custom
555 Hor. Is it a custom?
556 At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
557 No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
558 Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
559 In filial obligation for some term
560 Together with that fair and warlike form
561 And there assume some other, horrible form
562 To cast thee up again. What may this mean
563 For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
564 He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
565 'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
566 gentleman.'
567 Holds such an enmity with blood of man
568 Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman! -
569 O most pernicious woman!
570 Thou canst not then be false to any man.
571 Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
572 Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
573 What we two nights have seen.
574 Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
575 Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
576 The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
577 Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
578 Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
579 Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
580 Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
581 Come hither, gentlemen,
582 The form of plausive manners, that these men
583 So oft it chances in particular men
584 Unto our climature and countrymen.
585 Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
586 Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
587 That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
588 With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
589 Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
590 Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
591 Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
592 It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
593 Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
594 Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
595 As oft as any passion under heaven
596 Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
597 Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
598 I shall not look upon his like again.
599 Perchance 'twill walk again.
600 Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
601 But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
602 And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
603 Enter Ghost again.
604 That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
605 O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
606 Polonius, Lord Chamberlain.
607 And we beseech you, bend you to remain
608 Â«Public DomainÂ»,
609 Within the book and volume of my brain,
610 Without more motive, into every brain
611 A Norwegian Captain.
612 Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
613 To his confine; and of the truth herein
614 Since nature cannot choose his origin, -
615 Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
616 Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
617 Such was the very armour he had on
618 And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
619 And prologue to the omen coming on,
620 In honourable fashion.
621 But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
622 I'll cross it, though it blast me. â€“ Stay illusion!
623 This present object made probation.
624 Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
625 To show my duty in your coronation,
626 The very place puts toys of desperation,
627 And they in France of the best rank and station
628 Mar. Look with what courteous action
629 And keep you in the rear of your affection,
630 According to the phrase or the addition
631 Why should we in our peevish opposition
632 So horridly to shake our disposition
633 Shall in the general censure take corruption
634 By this encompassment and drift of question
635 By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
636 For what we know must be, and is as common
637 Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
638 And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
639 To put an antic disposition on),
640 Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
641 If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
642 My custom always of the afternoon,
643 Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
644 (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
645 Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
646 Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
647 Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
648 Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
649 Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
650 Than that which dearest father bears his son
651 But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
652 You laying these slight sullies on my son
653 The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
654 Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
655 And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
656 Hor. Well, sit we down,
657 And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
658 My tables! Meet it is I set it down
659 As are companions noted and most known
660 Now wears his crown.
661 As if increase of appetite had grown
662 His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
663 Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
664 Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
665 Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.
666 Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
667 Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
668 And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
669 Exit Reynaldo
670 That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
671 Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
672 Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.
673 Fran. Bernardo?
674 Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down at his post; then] Bernardo,
675 He may not, as unvalued persons do,
676 Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
677 And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
678 I do beseech you give him leave to go.
679 As infinite as man may undergo-
680 Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
681 Ham. Saw? who?
682 Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
683 And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
684 There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
685 Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
686 Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
687 Mar. Question it, Horatio.
688 Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
689 Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
690 Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
691 As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
692 Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
693 Oph. No more but so?
694 Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
695 Ber. It would be spoke to.
696 Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
697 Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to

701 And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
702 Hor. Hail to your lordship!
703 For out o' doors he went without their help
704 Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
705 Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
706 Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
707 Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
708 The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
709 Ham. For God's love let me hear!
710 Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
711 Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
712 Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
713 The glowworm shows the matin to be near
714 Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
715 Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
716 Ghost. [beneath] Swear.

718 Ghost. Swear.
719 Swear.

732 Both. Longer, longer.
733 Ghost of Hamlet's Father.
734 But you must know, your father lost a father;
735 Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
736 Hor. My lord, the King your father.
737 To give these mourning duties to your father;
738 The apparition comes. I knew your father.
739 Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
740 My father- methinks I see my father.
741 My father's brother, but no more like my father
742 Ham. The King my father?
743 God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
744 Nay, come, let's go together.
745 Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
746 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
747 Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother

750 Ham. Murther?
751 Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
752 May give his saying deed; which is no further
753 Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.

765 Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
766 How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
767 To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever
768 Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
769 With an attent ear, till I may deliver
770 O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
771 Giving to you no further personal power

773 But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
774 Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
775 Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
776 Ham. I am very glad to see you. â€“ [To Bernardo] Good even, sir. -
777 Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
778 Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
779 Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
780 Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
781 Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
782 Of his behaviour.
783 As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
784 All. Our duty to your honour.
785 And in the porches of my ears did pour
786 Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
787 With windlasses and with assays of bias,
788 To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
789 To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
790 His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
791 Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
792 Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
793 Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
794 Ham. Hold off your hands!
795 And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
796 Importing the surrender of those lands
797 Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
798 Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
799 A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
800 O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,
801 As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
802 Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
803 I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
804 Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,

810 When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
811 Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
812 Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
813 I stay too long. But here my father comes.
814 Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
815 Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
816 And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
817 As harbingers preceding still the fates
818 At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark. [Writes.]
819 What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
820 And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
821 Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes
822 You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?

832 If with too credent ear you list his songs,
833 And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
834 Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
835 Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
836 So excellent a king, that was to this
837 Ham. But where was this?
838 To tell us this.
839 Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
840 And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
841 Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
842 With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
843 Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
844 With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
845 Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'

847 Hor. No, by no means!
848 Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens

852 Is the main motive of our preparations,

854 But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
855 Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
856 And let us once again assail your ears,
857 Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
858 That was and is the question of these wars.

868 With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
869 Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
870 With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
871 But mere implorators of unholy suits,
872 Lords, ladies, Officers, Soldiers, Sailors, Messengers, Attendants.
873 And even the like precurse of fierce events,

898 Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
899 The cock crows.
900 Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
901 Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
902 Ham. What?
903 As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
904 Are most select and generous, chief in that.
905 And for my soul, what can it do to that,
906 Oph. Do you doubt that?
907 I would know that.
908 Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
909 Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
910 Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
911 But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
912 Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
913 The leperous distilment; whose effect
914 (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
915 Enter Ghost and Hamlet.
916 Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet
917 Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
918 As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
919 Mar. Lord Hamlet!
920 Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
921 That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
922 King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
923 This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
924 The Tragedy of Hamlet,
925 Horatio, friend to Hamlet.
926 Getrude, Queen of Denmark, mother to Hamlet.
927 Ghost beckons Hamlet.
928 Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
929 Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
930 Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet
931 Exeunt [all but Hamlet]
932 But you'll be secret?
933 Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
934 And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
935 Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
936 Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
937 From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
938 Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
939 Ber. Well, good night.
940 Fran. Give you good night.
941 In the dead vast and middle of the night
942 Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
943 Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
944 Hold you the watch to-night?
945 Ham. I will watch to-night.
946 Let us impart what we have seen to-night
947 Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
948 Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
949 And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
950 Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
951 With us to watch the minutes of this night,
952 Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
953 That ever I was born to set it right!
954 And vanish'd from our sight.
955 If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
956 Pol. Marry, well bethought!
957 But answer made it none. Yet once methought
958 Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
959 Ham. So be it!
960 So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
961 It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
962 Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
963 And, sister, as the winds give benefit
964 And draw you into madness? Think of it.
965 To let you know of it.
966 And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
967 Than your particular demands will touch it.
968 Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
969 But do not go with it!
970 Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
971 Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
972 Ham. No, you will reveal it.
973 Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
974 He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
975 Ham. Did you not speak to it?
976 But truly I do fear it.
977 Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
978 Thus much the business is: we have here writ
979 Hor. Heaven will direct it.
980 Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
981 It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
982 Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me. Exit.
983 Laer. Farewell. Exit.
984 Give you good night. Exit.
985 Exit.
986 Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
987 Of general assault.
988 and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,] Lords Attendant.
989 And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
990 Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
991 Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
992 A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
993 Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
994 But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
995 Contagious blastments are most imminent.
996 Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
997 Against the which a moiety competent
998 Do I impart toward you. For your intent
999 What think you on't?
1000 I have sworn't.
1001 Where we shall find him most conveniently. Exeunt.
1002 Exeunt
1003 Exeunt
1004 Exeunt
1005 No reckoning made, but sent to my account
1006 Laer. O, fear me not!
1007 Both. My lord, we will not.
1008 Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
1009 Shall you my son. You have me, have you not
1010 Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
1011 Both. My lord, from head to foot.
1012 Ghost. I find thee apt;
1013 The head is not more native to the heart,
1014 And I am sick at heart.
1015 And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
1016 Ham. Nay, but swear't.
1017 Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart
1018 I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
1019 We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
1020 Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
1021 Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
1022 To make it truster of your own report
1023 And with a look so piteous in purport
1024 Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
1025 Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
1026 By laboursome petition, and at last
1027 All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
1028 A couch for luxury and damned incest.
1029 A Priest.
1030 Give me one poor request.
1031 This heavy-headed revel east and west
1032 To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
1033 Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
1034 Enter Ghost.
1035 Enter Ghost.
1036 Exit Ghost
1037 Exit Ghost
1038 Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
1039 She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
1040 Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
1041 So to seduce! â€“ won to his shameful lust
1042 Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
1043 And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
1044 Ham. My fate cries out
1045 By indirections find directions out.
1046 The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
1047 Hor. Not when I saw't.
1048 Who hath reliev'd you?
1049 Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
1050 Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
1051 And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
1052 Mark you,
1053 It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
1054 And that in way of caution- I must tell you
1055 But let me hear from you.
1056 King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
1057 Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
1058 What I have said to you.
1059 Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
1060 With all my love I do commend me to you;
1061 May do t' express his love and friending to you,
1062 This marvel to you.
1063 So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
1064 Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
1065 I'll visit you.
1066 You, as your business and desires shall point you,
1067 Ham. Arm'd, say you?
1068 Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
1069 Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
1070 Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
1071 But I have that within which passeth show-
1072 Not of that dye which their investments show,
1073 Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
1074 Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
1075 Oph. My lord, I do not know,
1076 Ham. What hour now?
1077 See you now-
1078 Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
1079 And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
1080 That it went hand in hand even with the vow
1081 Ber. Say-
1082 Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
1083 And it must follow, as the night the day,
1084 From the first corse till he that died to-day,
1085 No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
1086 I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
1087 For they are actions that a man might play;
1088 That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
1089 And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
1090 Look you, I'll go pray.
1091 Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
1092 say?
1093 Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
1094 And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
1095 Ber. See, it stalks away!
1096 For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,
1097 Fortinbras, Prince of Norway.
1098 Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
1099 Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
1100 That he is open to incontinency.
1101 Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
1102 Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
1103 The natural gates and alleys of the body,
1104 All my smooth body.
1105 And makes each petty artire in this body
1106 With which she followed my poor father's body
1107 Unto the voice and yielding of that body
1108 But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
1109 Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
1110 Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
1111 Yes, faith, heartily.
1112 Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
1113 King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
1114 Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
1115 You do not understand yourself so clearly
1116 Hor. Most constantly.
1117 That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
1118 Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
1119 Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
1120 Well ratified by law and heraldry,
1121 And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
1122 And our vain blows malicious mockery.
1123 And these few precepts in thy memory
1124 Yea, from the table of my memory
1125 That are so fortified against our story,
1126 Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'â€“ Ay, marry!
1127 That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
1128 Of man and country-
1129 Is not this something more than fantasy?
1130 Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
1131 From me, whose love was of that dignity
1132 Passing through nature to eternity.
1133 To his unmast'red importunity.
1134 As in their birth, â€“ wherein they are not guilty,
1135 To youth and liberty.
1136 That they may seem the taints of liberty,
1137 As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
1138 And we did think it writ down in our duty
1139 Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
1140 Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
1141 Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
